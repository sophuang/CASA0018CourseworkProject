# CASA0018 Project: Playing Rock paper scissors with Computers

## Aim 

The idea of this project is to create a simple program on Arduino IDE to complete tasks including recognizing which gesture the user gives; generate a choice randomly; And then compare them and use LED light as an output to tell the user whether they win the computer or not.

The aim of this project is to build a model that can reach an accuray upto 80% in recognising user's gesture.

## Data source

The data for the model training was collected by using Edge Impulse:
Dataset size: 423 training/74 testing (85%/15%) \n
Paper: 121 training/21 testing \n
Rock: 152 training/27 testing \n
Scissors: 150 training/26 testing \n

## Model used

Transfer learning is used for this project. The convolutional neural network MobileNetV1 is used.\n
